The biggest takeaway from this Rails project was that i started to love Abstraction.

## Building Worlds from Scratch
Years before this course I've always been doing little coding projects. In those I loved to create my own worlds of logic and start everything from scratch, even the database system was created from scratch, not even SQL was used, but I was creating my own database logic fishing from JSON files that hold JS objects and attributes.

What I loved about coding was that starting from 0 you created this monumental machine of tricks and little stratagems that made all work together for a final goal.

## From Weaver to Fashion Designer
Coming to this course it felt as if all of the fun of creating those worlds of logic was taken away and I was left to learn the mechanisms made from some other experts.
All became centered in understanding those given worlds of logic... and the process to fit into their ways is like fitting into a new pair of jeans, at first it always feels more awkward than the old jeans.

But then things start to come together and suddenly you feel that being forced into those ways forces you into building things with a process that makes you much more efficient, the worlds of logic just comes together harmonically all at once. 
It just feels so silly that you were trying to make your own jeans, now you can just pick all the clothes you want, they all match each other, they have standardised accessories and you can concentrate on expressing your style and come up with the best outfit rather than spending days to thread that wires in pattern that often don't match.

It may feel restrictive in the beginning where being forced in a certain framework seems to jeopardise the expressivity of the model you had in mind, but in reality it forces you to sanitise that ideas and make it fit in a system that works.

When building projects from scratch, it was fun initially, but once the project reached a certain level of maturity you realised that the foundations of that monumental building of tricks of logic and mechanisms was not sound and updating it was becoming a monumental hard job too.

With higher level libraries and frameworks you can become like an orchestra director, you still have to understand the mechanisms behind everything but you can have a higher level of expressivity and you know that if you use your orchestra appropriately, everything will come together just nice, leaving you with a higher level of expressivity than just you playing your own single instrument.

## Art not Science
Another thing that I have absorbed during this project, is that there isn't really a right way to approach a problem through a certain database schema, routing system and/or controller/action layout, it all depends on how you want to present the informations related to that problem. It is like an art not a science, there isn't only one correct way to do things there is a lot of ways to express things with all kind of nuances.
It is more about expressivity than about fixing a clear problem.

With abstraction it is also easier to just draft working ideas and then continue the creative development from that working prototype. Much harder to make prototypes when building from scratch.

## Final Thoughts
It is hard to become an orchestra director and I am still not quite able to lead all of those musicians, can't even remember all of their names or even all of those instruments! and I mess up when I raise my hand to scratch my head.
I became more confident in delegating all the trickery to someone else's library  and framework, and just trust the process.
